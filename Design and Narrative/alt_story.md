## Themes
Treachery and Trust, Self reliance, Courage, Personal Growth, Disillusionment or Loss of innocence, Perseverance

## Prologue

Game opens with the main character living with other survivors in a boarded up building.This could be inside or near the hotel on the map.
They have plenty of food and supplies. There can be some dialogue to establish that these people are living like a family together (however they don't have to be family)
for a while and they feel safe. However there is a very real danger outside the walls of their safe haven.
It can also be established that our main character is not really 'the main character' other people go out for supply runs, fight hordes of zombies and face all kinds of dangers.
While our MC is just an average guy trying to survive, but barely able to fight off a single zombie.

MC: Back from your supply run already?

Badass 1: Didn't go, actually.

Badass 2: Too much zombie activity tonight. Better to wait it out.

MC: I wish I could help you guys out there. I barely do anything around here.

Badass 1: Hey, it's okay, kid! You help plenty. You're the only one who can cook anything that doesn't taste like burnt rubber.

Badass 2: Yeah, and you clean the place. We'd be living in piles of garbage if it weren't for you.

Badass 2: Honestly, it's terrible out there. Too dangerous. I wish I could stay here too.

MC: Yeah... I guess you're right.

MC: I do tend to freeze when faced with one of those things.

MC: I won't be much help...

MC: I'd probably die just tripping on some rubble... haha.

Badass 2: Ha! Kid, we won't make it much longer without you either.

MC: Nah you guys...

Badass 1: Shush...

Badass 1: (whisper) I heard something...

(cue windows shattering, and doors breaking down to let the zombie horde enter) 

After the dialogues, there is a scripted event where a zombie horde will break into the shelter, most of the survivors will be killed off and rest will run.
MC runs and hides. We can give a gun to the player at this point but maybe have some kind of post-processing effect that handicaps the player and indicates that MC is panicking.
We make it very obvious that at this point its better for player to run.
Once the player is away from the building, with only the gun and the clothes on their back, the prologue ends and actual game begins.

## I need supplies
MC monologues about needing supplies and food. And heads for the store. Game difficulty should be fairly low at this point.
There should be occasional zombies on the road and store can have some more for player to clear before they can get some food items. However ammo should be limited.
We can also give player a melee weapon.

## Hope of a new home
while searching for supplies in the store, player will find a map or a newspaper clipping to introduce the first overarching goal of the game.
There is a large colony of survivors established by the army in the 'Red desert' (or could be a different area). MC decides to go find that place.
Player is given a checklist of places to hit for supplies before they can go on this journey:
- Pharmacy
- Church
- Police station (could be added on the other side of the river)

To reach the pharmacy and the police station, the player need to repair the bridge. So the obvious place for them to go first is the church.

## Unexpected trouble then unexpected help
When player reaches the church, a scripted even will spawn a zombie horde and put the player in some danger.
However suddenly shots are fired from the above and zombies are quickly dealt with.
Apparently the priest was hiding in the church all this time and he have a stockpile of supplies. There can be some dialogue here.
Priest is hesitant to offer his supplies but he gives the player some ammo. And he suggests that the bridge can be repaired by using materials from the church furniture.
He would have already done it but he is an old man and won't leave the church for fear of zombies.
He offers to cover you from the church tower while you repair the bridge.

## Bridge repair
I don't know if we want to have extra mechanics coded. But this can be a small mission where player picks planks of wood one by one, from the church and deposit them on the bridge to repair.
Player has to avoid zombies while doing this and they can't fight zombies while carrying the planks.
The priest will take out the occasional zombie by firing from the church tower but we don't want him to be too helpful and keep this somewhat challenging for the player.

## On the other side
Across the river, player can first clear the pharmacy first and get their health back.
The police station can be somewhat harder to clear but we reward the player with ammo and maybe another gun.
Player is ready to continue onto the main quest and exit the area.

## The first betrayal
Crossing back over to the church, player starts getting shot at. Apparently the priest couldn't resist getting his hands on all these supplies and decided to get rid of you.
This can be made apparent by a small cutscene or camera pan over to priest in his tower and some dialogue. 
Player must take cover and try to take the priest out. 
This can play out like a boss fight and go through phases of priest shooting at the player, then an interval of priest stopping to reload while zombies (attracted by the noise) 
spawn and attack the player. The priest starts shooting again once these zombies are dealt with and it repeats like that until priest is defeated or player dies.
As a reward player gets to loot priest's supplies.

## Side quest 1
If player wanders over to the bank, they'll find a bunch of bankers trapped their and a horde of zombies trying to get in. The banker are throwing money out of the window to tempt the player into helping them.
The bankers are supposed to be unlikable but if the player does help them, they are rewarded with a cosmetically unique melee or ranges weapon (like pens and pencils tapped to an office chair leg as a parody of the nailed bat)

## Side quest 2
Can't think of anything yet. Maybe need more interesting places in the first zone to explore.
Will fill in the rest below slowly.


## Next Area
## Introduce unique and more powerful enemies
## More hints and info about the promised land (the survivor colony) maybe something ominous about that place
## Player reaches the colony and finds it smaller than they hoped. However it is safe and there are survivors.
## Leader of the colony want the player to prove themselves. And sends them out on a mission with some his people.
## Leader's people try to kill the player while on the mission and player finds that it was all master minded by the leader.
## Player deals with these enemies
## Player must return and take revenge. This is the second overarching goal. The second part of the main mission. Meanwhile, player is free to roam and gather supplies
## This part can be expanded will multiple quests and the end player can finally kill the leader.
## There can be a mechanic to lure zombie hordes and player can use this to attack the enemy base.
## MC has grown into a badass and gone through a difficult journey to learn that they don't need other people to survive.
## Game can end here or continue MC's growth toward a more balanced personality where they may learn to trust again.
