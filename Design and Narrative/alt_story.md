## Function
Game's story will facilitate the implementation of the core gameplay loop which is: 

Quest > Fight Enemies > Collect Rewards > Next Quest

Story will help provide context for each enemy encounter and gameplay sections and add emotional weight and meaning to the game. The overarching story will tie each quest together creating a cohesive plot and a compelling world with believable characters and relatable themes.


## Gameplay Loops
Primary loop of the game is fighting enemies. These can be zombies or human enemies.

A secondary game loop involves managing the hunger meter. Player must explore and gather supplies to keep their hunger down or suffer debuffs.

Another secondary game loop is upgrades. Player must explore the game areas to gather ammo and better weapons to improve their ability to fight enemies. Better weapons allow player to take on bigger and harder enemies. Which will unlock access to better weapons and so on. Also known as a positive feedback loop.

A tertiary game loop is completing quests. Player will encounter events or NPCs which will give them a quest and player can complete this quest to get rewards and unlock more quests. These quests may involve, fighting enemies, gathering supplies or retrieving quest items.

Its important to note that having a diverse set of mechanics will avoid the problem of repetitive gameplay and player getting bored. Each gameplay section should have something different to offer even if small. For example not all section needs to be centred around fighting enemies. But even if they are, here's a list of variations on this mechanics:

- Evade and dodge zombies while solving a puzzle or playing some other mini game
- Lure zombies into traps
- Navigate through a large horde of zombies without fighting them. This could involve outrunning and dodging their attacks.
- Escort NPCs from one point to another while fighting or avoiding zombies. Player can influence NPC movement because NPC will follow them.
- Protect NPCs from an attack. Different from the escort as the NPC could be stationary or moving without player's control.
- Kill off zombies from afar with a sniper
- Introduce powerful or unique enemies with for example ranged attack, unique movement, extra health, extra damage or some other unique mechanic to them.
- Boss fights and arenas
- Add limitations. Let player only use a specific weapon. Or have the player solve a problem without killing any enemies.
 

## Story Loops
Story progresses in two ways:
1. Character story is told via quests and mechanics. Player will start off underpowered, inexperienced and weak. They will gain experience and equipment by completing quests and getting weapons and ammo as rewards.
2. Lore is revealed through collectibles in the form of notes or newspaper clippings. These can be collected via exploration or as rewards for quests and events.

In short the main character starts their journey as weak and helpless survivor. They must gather supplies, ammo and weapons, first to survive and later to go and kill the big villain. Along the way they may find other good or bad people (NPCs).

Emotionally main character starts off as feeling inadequate and naive. Through the story quests and introduction of other NPCs we reveal the reality of the world to both the player and the main character. Effectively granting a kind of maturity to the main character which will in turn reflect in their actions.

Each quest will aim to teach and build some aspect of the world to the player. 

For example, a quest will show how most people are not to be trusted lightly. NPCs will be shown to behave in selfish ways. 

Another quest may explore how people don't trust other people. NPCs will show distrust of the player.

Other examples may include:
- People's actions due to a food shortage
- People turning into bandits 
- People living as loners
- People forming communities
- Distrust of strangers
- The good in people despite the circumstances 
- Integrity of one's own morals (main character's)   


## Main Character's Emotional Arc
Apparently this is called a Man in a Hole Arc. Main character will experience a loss or a great setback. And then they must climb/rise out of this hole.
It won't be easy and it won't a short struggle but the only place to go is up.

- Comfort zone: MC is living in a protected place but they are missing something. They haven't unlocked their full potential.
- Trigger: Bad luck strikes and their shelter and protectors are destroyed.
- Crisis: MC has to fend for himself. No support and no supplies. They are in a hole. The real world is hell but the experience will be valuable.
- Recovery: MC starts to understands the world and navigate it better. In RL, player is getting better at the game while MC is getting better weapons and equipment in game.
- Better place: The climax is achieved when MC does a great deed. For example, getting the world rid of a villain. MC is experienced and he has made some new friends along the way.


## Character Descriptions

### Main Character 
Naive. Starts out feeling inadequate and insecure. Relies heavily on others to protect them. Too trusting. Will grow to be capable and jaded.

"I'd probably die just tripping on some rubble... haha."

### Badass 1
More a plot device than a character. Capable and experienced survivor. Physically strong. Protective and supportive of MC.

"Shush... (whisper) I heard something..."

### Badass 2
Same as Badass 2.

"Too dangerous out there. I wish I could stay here too."

### Priest
Clever. Intelligent. Wise. A bit selfish but understandably so, given the circumstances.

"I'm an old man. But you can repair the bridge. I'll help you of course."

### Science Teacher
Resourceful. Battle hardened. Smart. Experienced. Doesn't trust easily or at all. Honest.

"I don't trust you. And you shouldn't trust me either."

### Urchin
A small figure. Not clear if its a girl or a boy. Appears out of nowhere to steal things. Quick but not very strong.


## Story Summary (So far)

MC loses their shelter and is alone in the zombie infested town without supplies. 

The MC heads to the town's only store for food and clears it of the zombies first.

The meagre supplies in the store are snatched instead by a small figure. MC is forced to give chase. 

Rounding the corner, the figure crouches on top of a broken-down car, surrounded by zombies. 

The MC rescues them, but they manage to start the car and drive off. A crash is heard off screen.

MC discover the car crashed into a fence and abandoned. A trail of blood leads to the church.

MC reaches the church but is ambushed by zombies instead.

MC is rescued by the priest from the tower using a sniper rifle.

The child MC was chasing is injured and needs medical supplies. The only pharmacy is across the broken bridge.

MC must repair the bridge. Priest offers the church pews as material for a plank bridge. An axe and rope is needed however.

MC searches the town for an axe and finds a fire axe in the bank, where some funny bankers are still trapped.

MC repairs the bridge, unlocks the rest of the town and heads for the pharmacy.

MC faces bandits while exiting pharmacy and barely survives.

MC delivers the medical supplies, saves the child, and then heads back across the bridge out of town.

MC encounters the Teacher and helps her capture some zombies.

Teacher wants to buy priest's sniper and MC must deliver this offer.

Back at the church, MC finds priest injured from a bandit attack and dying. The child runs off with the sniper.

## Prologue

Game opens with the main character living with other survivors in a boarded up building.This could be inside or near the hotel on the map.
They have plenty of food and supplies. There can be some dialogue to establish that these people are living like a family together (however they don't have to be family)
for a while and they feel safe. However there is a very real danger outside the walls of their safe haven.
It can also be established that our main character is not really 'the main character' other people go out for supply runs, fight hordes of zombies and face all kinds of dangers.
While our MC is just an average guy trying to survive, but barely able to fight off a single zombie.

MC: Back from your supply run already?

Badass 1: Didn't go. Too much zombie activity tonight.

MC: I wish I could help you guys out there. I barely do anything around here.

Badass 1: Hey, you help plenty. You're the only one who can cook anything decent.

Badass 2: Yeah, and you keep this place clean. We'd be living in garbage without you. 

Badass 2: It's terrible out there. Too dangerous. I wish I could stay here too.

MC: Yeah... I guess you're right. I freeze when faced with those things. 

MC: I'd probably die just tripping on some rubble... haha.

Badass 2: Ha! Kid, we won't make it much longer without you either.

MC: Nah you guys...

Badass 1: Shush... (whisper) I heard something...

(cue windows shattering, and doors breaking down to let the zombie horde enter) 

After the dialogues, there is a scripted event where a zombie horde will break into the shelter, most of the survivors will be killed off and rest will run.
MC runs and hides. We can give a gun to the player at this point but maybe have some kind of post-processing effect that handicaps the player and indicates that MC is panicking.
We make it very obvious that at this point its better for player to run.

Once the player is away from the building, with only the gun and the clothes on their back, the prologue ends and actual game begins.

## I need supplies
MC monologues about needing supplies and food. And heads for the store. Game difficulty should be fairly low at this point.
There should be occasional zombies on the road and store can have some more for player to clear before they can get some food items. However ammo should be limited.
We can also give player a melee weapon.

## Hope of a new home
while searching for supplies in the store, player will find a map or a newspaper clipping to introduce the first overarching goal of the game.
There is a large colony of survivors established by the army in the 'Red desert' (or could be a different area). MC decides to go find that place.
Player is given a checklist of places to hit for supplies before they can go on this journey:
- Pharmacy
- Church
- Police station (could be added on the other side of the river)

To reach the pharmacy and the police station, the player needs to repair the bridge. So the obvious place for them to go first, is the church.

## Unexpected trouble then unexpected help
When player reaches the church, a scripted event will spawn a zombie horde and put the player in some danger.
However suddenly shots are fired from the above and zombies are quickly dealt with.
Apparently the priest was hiding in the church all this time and he have a stockpile of supplies. There can be some dialogue here.

Priest is hesitant to offer his supplies but he gives the player some ammo. And he suggests that the bridge can be repaired by using materials from the church furniture.
He would have already done it but he is an old man and won't leave the church for fear of zombies.
He offers to cover you from the church tower while you repair the bridge.

## Bridge repair
I don't know if we want to have extra mechanics coded. But this can be a small mission where player picks planks of wood one by one from the church and deposits them on the bridge to repair.
Player has to avoid zombies while doing this and they can't fight zombies while carrying the planks.
The priest will take out the occasional zombie by firing from the church tower but we don't want him to be too helpful and keep this somewhat challenging for the player.

## On the other side
Across the river, player can first clear the pharmacy first and get their health back.
The police station can be somewhat harder to clear but we reward the player with ammo and maybe another gun.
Player is ready to continue onto the main quest and exit the area.

## The first betrayal
Crossing back over to the church, player starts getting shot at. Apparently the priest couldn't resist getting his hands on all these supplies and decided to get rid of you.
This can be made apparent by a small cutscene or camera pan over to priest in his tower and some dialogue. 
Player must take cover and try to take the priest out. 
This can play out like a boss fight and go through phases of priest shooting at the player, then an interval of priest stopping to reload while zombies (attracted by the noise) 
spawn and attack the player. The priest starts shooting again once these zombies are dealt with and it repeats like that until priest is defeated or player dies.
As a reward player gets to loot priest's supplies.

## Side quest 1
If player wanders over to the bank, they'll find a bunch of bankers trapped their and a horde of zombies trying to get in. The banker are throwing money out of the window to tempt the player into helping them.
The bankers are supposed to be unlikable but if the player does help them, they are rewarded with a cosmetically unique melee or ranges weapon (like pens and pencils tapped to an office chair leg as a parody of the nailed bat)
Money is worthless in apocalypse but bankers are entertaining so it wasn't a total loss.

## Side quest 2
MC sees something truly strange when approaching the far side of the town where the patrol station is.
Large man sized metal cages have been suspended in the air along the electric and telephone poles near the station and some zombies are roaming around aimlessly.

As you draw near, a disheveled head pokes out from the lip of the station roof. Hard eyes examine you for a good minute before the rest of the face appears.
Its a woman who you recognise as the science teacher in the local school before the apocalypse.

She has a peculiar quest for you: Help her capture zombies.
Kite the zombies around until one of them is exactly below one of the cages. At that point she'll press a button on a remote and drop the heavy cage.
Do this for 3 zombies.
 
There can be some dialogue between the teacher and the MC which explains why the teacher is capturing these zombies (for science of course).
The teacher will also warn the player to not trust people so easily. She says she could have easily captured the player as well if she wanted to, because player was under a cage multiple times.
She'll also show a lack of trust in the player and warn them to not get too close.
This will establish what kind of world the game is set it. How most people act and how they expect to be treated. 

## Next Area
## Introduce unique and more powerful enemies
## More hints and info about the promised land (the survivor colony) maybe something ominous about that place
## Player reaches the colony and finds it smaller than they hoped. However it is safe and there are survivors.
## Leader of the colony want the player to prove themselves. And sends them out on a mission with some his people.
## Leader's people try to kill the player while on the mission and player finds that it was all master minded by the leader.
## Player deals with these enemies
## Player must return and take revenge. This is the second overarching goal. The second part of the main mission. Meanwhile, player is free to roam and gather supplies
## This part can be expanded will multiple quests and the end player can finally kill the leader.
## There can be a mechanic to lure zombie hordes and player can use this to attack the enemy base.
## MC has grown into a badass and gone through a difficult journey to learn that they don't need other people to survive.
## Game can end here or continue MC's growth toward a more balanced personality where they may learn to trust again.
